Pelion Device Management Client is Apache 2.0 licensed open source software. We accept contributions from 3rd parties, if they agree to submit their changes with Apache 2.0 licensing. Arm will review all contributions and possibly make some modifications before merging them.

Due to the release process, all new releases are squashed code drops. Therefore, we cannot provide the full Git commit history in the releases.
